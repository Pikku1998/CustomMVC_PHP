# CustomMVC_PHP
A custom MVC framework built using Object-Oriented PHP.

In this Project, I built a complete custom MVC (Model View Controller) framework Called PrakashMVC using object oriented PHP. 
This framework is completely open source and you are free to change the name, add stuff, etc and use it as your own. 

This framework will include...

* A core library class to load controllers & methods from the URL (Also using .htaccess)
* A base controller class to load models and views
* A custom database library using PDO for all models to interact with the database using prepared statements
